        <p>Back in 2015 was when I first saw him. Unfortunately for him I was a quiet kid back then and ignored him completely. Then after 2018 he left to study and I forgot he existed, until Covid… </p>
        <p>Back in 2019 when Covid first started I started playing Minecraft with a bunch of friends and that’s where I met him again. Online through a game..</p>
        <p>I didn’t know someone could be that charming through and online game and I immediately had a crush. That summer in June when he came back I was more than excited to see him I knew I liked him already and I had a feeling he liked me too. So I decided to confess.</p>
        <p>But doing long distance wasn’t something I thought I could do so we decided to be friends until I couldn’t wait and asked him to be my boyfriend…. From then on our love started to grow everyday. It has been 2 years going on 3 since I started to love this man and I couldn’t be happier. We’re going to get married and live happily ever after. The end ❣️</p>
