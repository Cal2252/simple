          Hey baby,
          Happy birthday!!🫶🏻💗 I hope you have the best day ever even though I can’t be there to celebrate with you. I was trying to think of a present I could give online since I can’t give you physical gift ;-;; or a cake so here’s some cake 🎂🍰🧁. I hope you like the website!! 
           You’re the best boyfriend ever and I’m so so proud of you baby. I’m amazed by how much more I fall for you everyday. You make me so happy everyday,I could be having the worst day ever and when I hear your voice it all becomes better.I love you and when I say that I mean I love you on all your bad days and sad days, I love you more than this stupid distance between us or even any obstacle that could ever try and come between us.I love you soooooo much and hopefully we’ll be able to celebrate our birthdays together in the future when we’re growing older 🤞🏻.I will forever thankgod for bringing you into my life and showing me what unconditional love is,showing me how to smile even on my bad days. Plus youre totally hot as hell so that a bonus for me 😩. 
     
     With love 
     Riri ❣️
